# Playtesting

## Purpose and how to read this file

This is the active empirical front door for feature planning. It owns current
priorities, live WATCH items, current gameplay evidence, and concise recent
acceptance evidence. It does **not** select Roadmap sequencing; only
`ROADMAP.md` owns **NEXT** and **PLANNED**.

Raw user playtest notes are evidence inputs, not documentation-ready prose.
Synthesize current patterns, behavior changes, and status before adding them;
see `DOCUMENTATION_POLICY.md` → **Playtest Note Synthesis**.

Normal sessions should read this current portion, then only sections directly
relevant to the active milestone. Closed causal history lives in
`PLAYTESTING_ARCHIVE.md`; detailed parked Player Identity experiments live in
`PLAYER_IDENTITY_RESEARCH.md`. Neither archive is a normal read requirement.

Evidence uses this loop:

```text
observation → evidence → question/hypothesis → investigation → decision
```

Statuses: **OBSERVED** is unvalidated manual evidence; **INVESTIGATING** has
earned a diagnostic; **CONFIRMED** is established; **RESOLVED** is implemented
and validated; **WATCH** is currently acceptable but worth monitoring.

## Current Playtesting Priorities

1. Gather product/IA evidence needed to plan the Roadmap-selected Season
   Archive / Yearbook milestone.
2. Continue observing whether News → inspect → Follow → Alumni creates durable
   Player and Program attachment across normal multi-Season play.
3. Observe which Season facts players naturally want preserved before defining
   Records or Awards.
4. Monitor genuinely live WATCH items below without promoting them into work
   absent stronger evidence.

This priority list is evidence guidance, not an independent sequencing decision.
The authoritative milestone selection remains in `ROADMAP.md`.

## Live WATCH Items

### Low-prestige rebuild and mature-league ceiling

Pine Valley has felt like a genuine multi-year grind, and mature leagues have
occasionally produced one clear powerhouse with most Programs clustered below.
This remains interesting/acceptable. Reopen only if repeated play shows the
rebuild is inert or the league loses believable upper-tier Programs.

### Concentrated single-attribute Development gains

Development V1 creates varied career outcomes, but rare offseason gains can
concentrate heavily in one attribute. Monitor whether this produces implausible
Player identities; do not change Development from isolated examples.

### Rotation secondary-path edge cases

Interior/forward-heavy eligibility and rare large incumbent displacement remain
worth observing. Legal/manual 40-minute assignments are intentional; automatic
default workload realism is resolved and frozen.

### Premium Recruit Offer allocation

Premium Recruits sometimes attract many Board pursuers but fewer Offers. Prior
evidence often traced this to positional Offer capacity or selection of another
target. Any change requires a dedicated diagnostic; it is not part of current
feature work.

### Shot selection and statistical translation

Shot mix is simplified, and Steals/cross-position identities showed the clearest
historical compression. Player Identity tuning remains parked. Investigate only
if new manual play identifies a concrete repeated gameplay problem.

### Persistence and history growth

Save/load is absent and serialized Dynasty history grows across Seasons. These
are future product/engineering concerns, not confirmed blockers for the current
feature milestone.

## What Is Working / Fun Right Now

- Recruiting creates risk/reward choices rather than automatic elite classes.
- Low-Prestige programs can feel like real multi-year rebuilds.
- Development produces busts, modest careers, hits, and rare stars.
- Tournament upsets and painful exits create distinct Season stories.
- Graduation, Recruiting, Development, and rollover make rebuilding cyclical.
- News makes Players and Programs discoverable during ordinary progression.
- Following, Alumni, and Historical Player Details preserve attachment after
  graduation.
- Season Preview introduces names before current results create stories.

Preserve these strengths. A surprising result is evidence to interpret, not an
automatic defect.

## Active Phase Evidence — History and Recognition

Phase 7C has not been implemented. Current evidence supports beginning with a
Season Archive / Yearbook because the simulation already creates memorable
Season-level facts that become difficult to retrieve after rollover:

- champions, Tournament runs, upsets, and painful exits;
- standings, records, statistical leaders, and notable News stories;
- recruiting classes and important incoming Players;
- followed Players' Season context and eventual career progression; and
- the desire to revisit “what happened that year” before defining records or
  subjective awards.

Planning should determine the smallest useful player-facing archive from
canonical completed history. Do not infer that every item above belongs in
7C.1, and do not create new persisted duplicate history when existing archives
can support a projection.

## Recent Accepted-Phase Evidence

### Phase 7B — Player & League Stories — ACCEPTED / FROZEN

The accepted loop is:

```text
Season Preview → notice Player/Program → inspect → Follow
→ News during Season → Alumni after career
```

News acceptance established complete-checkpoint publication, useful Player and
Program navigation, Follow context, restrained outcome/multi-achievement copy,
and readable 390px presentation. Multi-Season play produced memorable stories,
including a discovered scorer followed through his senior Tournament exit.

Alumni acceptance established `active | former | unknown` resolution, retained
Follow intent, regular-season career aggregation, Historical Player Details,
Final/Peak OVR, Final Ratings, progression, and optional Recruiting Origin.

Season Preview acceptance established Season 1 and rollover cast projections,
Rounds 1–2 Hub promotion, persistent active-Season League News retrieval,
entity exploration, and local table scrolling at 390px. No Phase 7B feature
added simulation behavior or parallel canonical history.

Detailed acceptance narratives are preserved in `PLAYTESTING_ARCHIVE.md`.

## Parked Player Identity Evidence

Manual play produced both homogeneous-feeling Seasons and memorable outliers.
Diagnostics separated generation/profile supply, OVR valuation, role-aware
minutes, and statistical translation. The product decision is unchanged:

- current Player population is good enough for feature development;
- canonical generation and `calculateOverall()` remain production truth;
- Profile Generation Experiment A V2 is experimental input only;
- OVR Experiment B v1 is rejected; and
- tuning requires new gameplay evidence before reopening.

See `PLAYER_IDENTITY_RESEARCH.md` only when a current problem deliberately
reopens that work.

## Historical Evidence Index

  Recruiting IA, UI polish, Coaching, Followed Players, and Phase 7B acceptance:

- Accepted simulation/calibration formulas:
  `SIMULATION.md`
- Confirmed engineering issues and resolved ledger:

## Maintenance rule

Keep Current Playtesting Priorities and Live WATCH Items near the top. If closed
evidence pushes them down, summarize the durable conclusion and archive the
detail before adding more. At phase close, retain only evidence that still
affects current planning and move detailed closed narratives to
`PLAYTESTING_ARCHIVE.md`.
